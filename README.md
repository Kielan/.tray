This project is a module for Dune sculpt, a package architecture system in C++ to make development easier.
Think VSCode but more performant, no typescript wrapper, and an additional text replace template system for code prediction
which is easy to template in a .file directory. To understand think operator style architecture to teach an AI to predict code patterns.
Similar functionality to the paperclip guy from microsoft word 2001 and you can teach him yourself.

The super benefit is you can have like with github multiple branches of a project, but in a local container before it goes to github.
Version A or B of program UI code codebase can be switched back and forth with a .file reference.

global command line tool for placing your env or other critical files temporarily out of project directory.

Using the text editor native application or cli tool save multiple separate branched versions in a tray (tree) using yaml.

mini map editor on hover popup with hilighting, bulk text replaces, and full language conversions with a config file that works neatly with a code editor.
